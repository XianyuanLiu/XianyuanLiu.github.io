I currently serve as a Senior AI Research Engineer at the [School of Computer Science](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/), and as the Assistant Head of AI Research Engineering at the [Centre for Machine Intelligence](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/machine-intelligence), both at the [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/).

My current research focuses on developing machine learning methods and tools for materials science and multimodal learning. I take pride in co-founding and being the principal developer of [PyKale](https://github.com/pykale/pykale),  an open-source library that delivers a diverse range of easily accessible multi-modal and transfer learning algorithms.

I received my Ph.D. degree in Signal and Information Processing from the [University of Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://english.ucas.ac.cn/) in 2023. My academic journey began with a B.Eng. degree in Measuring Control Technology and Instruments from [Southeast University](https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/) in 2016. Additionally, I was a visiting researcher at the Department of Computer Science, University of Sheffield from 2019 to 2021.
